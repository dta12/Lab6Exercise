# NameGrader
An open source project by Dastan Abdulla and Brian Kim
# Software Use
This program asks the user for their name and the length of their name. After that, It returns an algorithmic score based on the relative position of each letter in their name and the alphabet.
# How to use it
## Installation
Clone the main repoistory labeled "Lab6Exercise" by copying the command below into your terminal of choice. After that, go into /src and then you have two choices there; either open the .py file, or open the .ipynb file which is a jupyter notebook file. If you go with the notebook path, you will need an Ide that recognizes ipynb files. Two possible options are the web jupyter software, or visual studio code. Both of the files behave in the same manner, it is up to you to decide which one you prefer.
``bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dta12/Lab6Exercise
``

## Usage
To begin using the software, either compile the .py file and then run it, or run the first code block in the .ipynb file. In both cases, they will ask you for your name. AFter typing that in and pressing enter, it will ask you for the number of letters in your name( do not count whitespaces, or any punctuation mark such as a hyphen). AFter typing both of these things in, the program will output a numeric result which is the score your name recieved. The score itself does not equate to any realistic value and it does not carry any meaning.
